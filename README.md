                                                 HEAL CO2 Emission Analysis Dashboard

Overview

During a university project, we created an interactive dashboard focused on CO2 emission analysis across various countries, along with their performance in electricity generation and consumption from Fossil Fuels and Renewables. This dashboard is designed to provide users with insights into environmental impacts, helping stakeholders make data-driven decisions to achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and promote cleaner energy initiatives.

Features

Interactive Country & Year Selection:
Users can select specific countries and years, allowing them to focus on detailed CO2 emissions data per capita for comparison. This also includes performance metrics in electricity generation and disaster-related economic losses.

CO2 Emissions Treemap:

A static treemap visualizes total emissions for the past 5 years, highlighting countries with the highest emissions and providing a clear view of those needing targeted interventions.

Line & Bar Graphs for Resource Usage:

The line graph shows a country's CO2 emissions trend over 5 years, color-coded to differentiate between fossil fuels and renewable sources.
Stacked bar graphs visualize each countryâ€™s reliance on fossil fuels versus renewable energy for electricity generation.
Fossil Fuel & Renewable Consumption Insights:
Horizontal bar graphs compare the fossil fuel consumption and electricity generation from renewable sources across the top 5 and bottom 5 countries. These comparisons help identify key areas where improvements can be made.

Deaths & Economic Losses by Disasters:

The dashboard also displays deaths and economic losses caused by climate-related disasters such as extreme temperatures, offering a comprehensive look at the human and economic impact of CO2 emissions.

Technology Stack

Backend & Data Analysis: Python, Excel
Data Visualization: Tableau.

How to Use

Users can interact with the dashboard by selecting the country and year from the provided dropdown menus. Hovering over different areas of the dashboard provides additional information, such as CO2 emission per capita or the impact of disasters. The static treemap remains constant, offering a holistic view of emissions over the last 5 years for quick comparisons.

Conclusion

This dashboard consolidates crucial environmental data into an easy-to-use platform, offering valuable insights for HEAL to focus its efforts on regions that need urgent attention in reducing CO2 emissions and transitioning towards sustainable energy. The project was instrumental in enhancing our data analysis and visualization skills while contributing to a meaningful cause.
